Box Stacking Problem: Dynamic Programming

In this project you can find java implementation to Box Stacking Problem which is a variation of LIS Problem.

The Time-Complexity for this algorithm is O(n^2).

This problem is to find the highest possible tower out of boxes whereas a box can only be on top of other box if its length and width is less than the other box.
